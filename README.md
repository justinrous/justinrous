Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am a current student studying computer science at Oregon State University. 
I have a keen interest in web development and currently working on a full stack e-commerce website. 
I'm currently learning React and would like to build a beginner-friendly project to supplement my learning.
Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn if you would like to collaborate.
